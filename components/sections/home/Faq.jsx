                $DPAY is not just another DRC-20 token. It&#39;s an emblem of
                the online zeitgeist, an extraordinary digital currency and
                ecosystem that transcends the norms of blockchain utility.
                Inspired by the fun and whimsical culture of the Doge meme,
                DogePay is on an unstoppable mission to make a difference â€” both
                in the blockchain universe and in the real world. We encourage
                the creation of Doge-tastic Doge ordinals aka Doginals and help
                folks with innovative inscription/shibescription services. We
                also developed a one-of-a-kind wallet and market for all your
                DRC-20 and Doginals needs.
